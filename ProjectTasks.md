stuff we need to work on: 

1) making sure the scanners work 
2) finishing these methods: 
- make shelter (checks wood, if there is a sufficient amount no resources will be lost. if there isn't you will continue to lose some)
3) make more method ideas + implement (current three: make shelter, find water, wild animals) 
4) day tracker method 
- randomized amount of obstacles define end of day (range 3-6)
