Welcome to your Island Adventure! A game that tests your ability to survive in the wild! Complete obstacles and win games to complete 10 days on the island. Good luck!

How to Play

Island2.java contains the biggest portion of the code, Game.java contains the main method.

- run Game.java and enjoy!
